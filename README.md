#Proposal:

Our story…
To overcome the complexity of wine tasting and finding the perfect wine. Our group is tasked with analyzing unknown Vinho Verde wines of Portugal for a new wine company PyWines Co. Our group is going to us ML technology and modeling to find and fit the “best” wine based on taste attributes.     


Our group is collecting data from Kaggle where we are analyzing and visualizing a wine quality dataset that is based on physiochemical properties of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 

#Objective:

Predict and visualize the quality of red and white wines based on taste attributes using ML (Sci-Kit Learn).

#Requirements:
ML (Sci-Kit Learn), Python Pandas, Tableau, Front-End (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap)

After thorough analysis, we were able to prove that Red and White wine have distinct characteristics that produce the best quality wines.  Another conclusion that was made was when all wines were be combined into a single dataset. The machine learning was able to produce accurate results thus proving all wines in general have a distribution of sugar, sulphates, citric acid levels (and etc.) that will produce a highly rated. But, this method not as precise as the Red and White individually and the high accuracy results can be attributed to having the most data to look at for the machine learning.
